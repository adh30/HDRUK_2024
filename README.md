# HDRUK_2024
Material on 'Reproducible workflows in Stata' for HDRUK interns 2024 including a Powerpoint slideset and some simple examples in Stata code. The original of Maarten Buis's mkproject (https://github.com/maartenteaches/mkproject) or my fork (https://github.com/adh30/mkproject) may also be useful.
